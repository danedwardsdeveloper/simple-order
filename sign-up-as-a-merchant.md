# Sign up as a merchant for existing customers

- Link appears on dashboard for customers who aren't merchants
  Either: Link to /free-trial and add to existing route... (more complex)
  Or: Link to /??? and create new route (more repetition)

## What's the truly MVP vertical slice for this feature?

1. Check they have a valid token
2. Check email is confirmed. Don't do this because you can't get to this stage without confirming your email!
3. Check customer isn't already a merchant
4. Create new trial
