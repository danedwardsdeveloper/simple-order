# Privacy Policy

## Our Principles

We run a direct and straightforward business. We make money by providing a valuable service that customers pay for.

- We use cookies for functionality, not surveillance
- We don't show ads
- We don't sell your data

## What we collect

- Only what we need to provide the service
- Email addresses to prevent abuse and for essential updates about your account
- That's it. We don't even see your payment information as that's handled by our payment provider, Stripe

## What we don't do

- No tracking or analytics cookies
- No marketing emails
- No third-party marketing tools
- No digital fingerprinting
- No data selling
- No "legitimate interest" nonsense

## Essential Cookies

For non-members who visit the site, there are no cookies whatsoever.

If you start a subscription:

`__stripe_mid` and `__stripe_sid`. When you make a payment, these third-party cookies are set by our payment provider, Stripe, to protect against fraud. As a courtesy, we delete them automatically if your payment goes through successfully.

For members:

Our `token` cookie is created when you sign in or create an account. Without this, the service wouldn't work.

## Data Storage

Your data is kept in our secure database for two years, then it's deleted. It's not for sale.

## Your Rights

You can export or delete your data at anytime. Just email us at privacy@simpleorder.co.uk and we will get it to you/delete it within one working day.

# Demand better

If you live in the UK and are as concerned about privacy as we are, please write to your local Member of Parliament and ask them what they are doing about the extraordinary violations that are, sadly, the norm.
