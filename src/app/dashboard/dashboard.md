# Ideas

-  Unprocessed orders received - Perfect for merchants to quickly see what needs attention
-  Unprocessed orders made - Great for customers to track their pending orders
-  Expired subscription notice - Critical for business continuity
-  Pending invitations - Important for network growth
-  Additional Minimal Dashboard Elements to Consider
-  Quick stats summary - A very simple number showing total orders for the current day/week (depending on which view makes more sense for bakeries)
-  Holiday mode indicator - A simple visual indicator showing whether your shop is currently in "holiday mode" so merchants can quickly confirm their status
-  Next scheduled orders - For standing orders, show the next upcoming scheduled delivery (just the next one, not all)
-  Toggle switch - A prominent toggle to switch between these views would be helpful
